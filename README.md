## Recent Projects

### MotiSpectra (https://github.com/sammyyyyy1/MotiSpectra)

Winner at ConUHacks 2024. Studies have shown that the majority of communication is not verbal - body language and facial expression matter too. However, as online conferencing has taken the world by storm, a lot of our communication has been lost through the screen. MotiSpectra is a tool to help bring that back, using computer vision and machine learning to give you, the presenter, an analysis of your audience's engagement and attentiveness. This tool can seamlessly integrate into conferencing platforms, such as Zoom, Google Meet, and MS Teams.
